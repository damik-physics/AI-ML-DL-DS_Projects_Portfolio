# Folder Structure

The repository is organized into15 folders, eachcorrespondingto a different machine learning project. Withineach project folder, you will find the following subfolders:

- `Data`: Contains the data used in the project, such as training and testing datasets.
- `Code`: Contains the code for the project, including any scripts or notebooks.
- `Presentation`: Containsany presentations or reports related to the project.


## Installation and Usage

To use the projects in the AI-ML-DL-DS_Projects_Portfolio repository, you will need to install Python and conda, as well as set up an environment to run the code. Here are the steps to follow:


If you do not already have Python and conda installed on your machine, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to install them.


Clone the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafabozkaya/AI-ML-DL-DS_Projects_Portfolio.git
```


Navigate to the root directory of the repository on your local machine using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd AI-ML-DL-DS_Projects_Portfolio
```


Create a new environment using the `conda create --name myenv --file requirement.txt` command, replacing `myenv` with the name of the environment you want to create. This will install all of the necessary packages for the projects in the repository.

```bash
`conda create --name myenv --file requirement.txt`
```


Activate the environment using the `conda activate myenv` command.

```bash
   conda activate myenv
```

To use a specific project, navigate to the project folder using the `cd` command and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that folder. Each project may have its own dependencies and usage instructions, so be sure to read the `README.md` file carefully.

For example, to use Project 1: Predicting Stock Prices using Financial Data, you would follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Project 1 folder:

   ```bash
   cd Project_1_Predicting_Stock_Prices_using_Financial_Data
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the Project 1 folder to run the code and analyze the data.
